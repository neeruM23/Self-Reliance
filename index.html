                Sexual violence is a general term that includes any sexual
                    activity inflicted or forced upon a person without his/her
                    consent. In all cases, the victim would not rationally or
                    willingly choose to participate in the activity or the person is
                    unable to give valid consent due to physical, mental or age
                    constraints. Sexual violence comprises crimes such as child
                    sexual abuse, sexual assault from intimate partners, friends,
                    dates or strangers; incest; sexual harassment; stalking; elder
                    abuse; and rape among some of its categories. A key factor in
                    determining whether a sexual act is deemed violent or abusive,
                    lies in the individual’s ability to give valid consent.<br />
    
                    <b>What is consent?</b> Legally, it refers to the minimum age at
                    which an individual is considered to be old enough to understand
                    the nature of sexual activities and to participate in them. In
                    psychological terms, it would also mean that the individual is
                    free of undue pressures and fully understands the nature of the
                    activity and wants to participate in it. Thus, consent also
                    signifies a certain level of maturity. For example, children
                    would not fully understand the nature of sexual activities as
                    their physical, emotional, social and cognitive development have
                    not reached completion. In Colorado, the legal age of consent is
                    17. At any age, however, whenever an individual is pressured,
                    manipulated, or forced to any sexual activity through either
                    physical force or violence, threats, intimidation, or by being
                    taken advantage of his/her trust, or by being drugged, or by
                    being intoxicated, the person is rendered unable to give valid
                    consent. The abuse or violence can be a single incident or
                    repeated incidents over long periods of time or years.
                    Perpetrators can be adults or youth. Sexually abusive or violent
                    behaviors include unwanted touching, fondling, groping, sexually
                    charged insults, sexually demeaning comments about a specific
                    gender or group, sexually charged gazes,
                    exhibiting/showing/receiving unwanted nude pictures, stalking,
                    sexual assault, and sexual abuse or assault to subordinates or
                    others under the perpetrator’s authority or power, among others.
                    At the center of these aberrant behaviors is denying the victim
                    of her/his ability to exercise the right to choose.<br />

                Child abuse (also called child endangerment or child
                    maltreatment) is physical, sexual, and/or psychological
                    maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a
                    parent or a caregiver. Child abuse may include any act or
                    failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual
                    or potential harm to a child and can occur in a child's home, or
                    in the organizations, schools, or communities the child
                    interacts with. The terms child abuse and child maltreatment are
                    often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a
                    distinction between them, treating child maltreatment as an
                    umbrella term to cover neglect, exploitation, and trafficking.
                    Different jurisdictions have different requirements for
                    mandatory reporting and have developed different definitions of
                    what constitutes child abuse, and therefore have different
                    criteria to remove children from their families or to prosecute
                    a criminal charge.<br />
                    Child abuse is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes.[132]
                    No single factor can be identified as to why some adults behave
                    abusively or neglectfully toward children.
                    <b> World Health Organization (WHO)</b> and the
                    <b
                      >International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and
                      Neglect (ISPCAN)</b
                    >
                    identify multiple factors at the level of the individual, their
                    relationships, their local community, and their society at
                    large, that combine to influence the occurrence of child
                    maltreatment. At the individual level, studies have shown that
                    age, mental health, and substance use, and a personal history of
                    abuse may serve as risk factors of child abuse.[133] At the
                    level of society, factors contributing to child maltreatment
                    include cultural norms that encourage harsh physical punishment
                    of children, economic inequality, and the lack of social safety
                    nets.[30] WHO and ISPCAN state that understanding the complex
                    interplay of various risk factors is vital for dealing with the
                    problem of child maltreatment.

                <strong>What Is Domestic Violence In India?</strong> The first
                    step to overcoming relationship abuse is understanding domestic
                    abuse meaning and what is meant by domestic violence. Domestic
                    violence is not only done by husbands. It is called relationship
                    abuse or domestic abuse even if it is by your parents, in-laws
                    and other family members too. Domestic abuse of elderly people
                    is also classified as domestic violence. Dowry harassment is a
                    type of domestic violence and often results in dowry deaths when
                    domestic abuse turns deadly. A young schoolgirl being touched by
                    any member of the family, teachers or older people, on her
                    breasts or her rear is also an act of violence. In fact, incest
                    and child sexual abuse are common forms of domestic violence in
                    India. In many cases, the battered women's own families are not
                    supportive of what they prefer to call a "domestic dispute"
                    because of the shame and guilt that surrounds such issues. But
                    no one deserves to be abused, and the law has remedies to
                    prevent relationship abuse, but we need to know the definition
                    of domestic violence and be aware of our legal rights. Domestic
                    violence is a serious threat to women in India, so you need to
                    know the signs of an abusive relationship, how to react to the
                    situation and how the law offers protection of women from
                    domestic abuse.
                    <b
                      >So, is domestic violence a cognizable offence or a crime? Is
                      relationship abuse a criminal offence? And are domestic
                      violence laws effective in India? If you perpetrate domestic
                      abuse, can you go to jail?</b
                    >
                    Yes, in fact, Section 498a of the Indian Penal Code, which
                    pertains to cruelty to women, states that domestic violence
                    punishment in India includes imprisonment of up to three years.
                    So, perpetrators of domestic abuse can face jail time in India.
                    <i
                      >"Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of
                      a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with
                      imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and
                      shall also be liable to fine."</i
                    >
                    Were you asked to leave your marital home? Can you force your
                    parents to provide for you? Are you facing emotional abuse from
                    your husband or facing emotional harassment by in-laws? Are you
                    facing domestic violence for dowry? Women in India have many
                    legal rights that can make a huge difference in their present
                    life and future. Know your legal rights and understand the laws
                    against domestic violence in India, so you can be confident,
                    aware and also fearless.

                <strong>You are not alone.</strong> Suicide is an important
                    issue in the Indian context. More than one lakh (one hundred
                    thousand) lives are lost every year to suicide in our country.
                    In the last two decades, the suicide rate has increased from 7.9
                    to 10.3 per 100,000. There is a wide variation in the suicide
                    rates within the country. The southern states of Kerala,
                    Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have a suicide rate of
                    less than 15 while in the Northern States of Punjab, Uttar
                    Pradesh, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir, the suicide rate is
                    greater than 3. This variable pattern has been stable for the
                    last twenty years. Higher literacy, a better reporting system,
                    lower external aggression, higher socioeconomic status and
                    higher expectations are the possible explanations for the higher
                    suicide rates in the southern states. The majority of suicides
                    (37.8%) in India are by those below the age of 30 years. The
                    fact that 71% of suicides in India are by persons below the age
                    of 44 years imposes a huge social, emotional and economic burden
                    on our society. The near-equal suicide rates of young men and
                    women and the consistently narrow male: female ratio of 1.4: 1
                    denotes that more Indian women die by suicide than their Western
                    counterparts. Poisoning (36.6%), hanging (32.1%) and
                    self-immolation (7.9%) were the common methods used to commit
                    suicide. Two large epidemiological verbal autopsy studies in
                    rural Tamil Nadu reveal that the annual suicide rate is six to
                    nine times the official rate.[3,4] If these figures are
                    extrapolated, it suggests that there are at least half a million
                    suicides in India every year. It is estimated that one in 60
                    persons in our country are affected by suicide. It includes
                    both, those who have attempted suicide and those who have been
                    affected by the suicide of a close family or friend. Thus,
                    suicide is a major public and mental health problem, which
                    demands urgent action. Although suicide is a deeply personal and
                    an individual act, suicidal behaviour is determined by a number
                    of individual and social factors. Ever since Esquirol wrote that
                    “All those who committed suicide are insane” and Durkheim
                    proposed that suicide was an outcome of social / societal
                    situations, the debate of individual vulnerability vs social
                    stressors in the causation of suicide has divided our thoughts
                    on suicide. Suicide is best understood as a multidimensional,
                    multifactorial malaise. Suicide is perceived as a social problem
                    in our country and hence, mental disorder is given equal
                    conceptual status with family conflicts, social maladjustment
                    etc.According to the official data, the reason for suicide is
                    not known for about 43% of suicides while illness and family
                    problems contribute to about 44% of suicides. Divorce, dowry,
                    love affairs, cancellation or the inability to get married
                    (according to the system of arranged marriages in India),
                    illegitimate pregnancy, extra-marital affairs and such conflicts
                    relating to the issue of marriage, play a crucial role,
                    particularly in the suicide of women in India. A distressing
                    feature is the frequent occurrence of suicide pacts and family
                    suicides, which are more due to social reasons and can be viewed
                    as a protest against archaic societal norms and expectations. In
                    a population-based study on domestic violence, it was found that
                    64% had a significant correlation between domestic violence of
                    women and suicidal ideation.Domestic violence was also found to
                    be a major risk factor for suicide in a study in Bangalore.The
                    population-based study has been done in various cities in India,
                    however the Bangalore study is the only psychological autopsy
                    study that focused on completed suicide and domestic violence.
                    Poverty, unemployment, debts and educational problems are also
                    associated with suicide. The recent spate of farmers' suicide in
                    India has raised societal and governmental concern to address
                    this growing tragedy.

                Drug abuse or substance abuse refers to the use of certain
                    chemicals for the purpose of creating pleasurable effects on the
                    brain. There are over 190 million drug users around the world
                    and the problem has been increasing at alarming rates,
                    especially among young adults under the age of 30.<br />
                    Apart from the long term damage to the body drug abuse causes,
                    drug addicts who use needles are also at risk of contracting HIV
                    and hepatitis B and C infections.<br />
                    <strong>Causes of drug use:</strong><br />
                    Drugs of abuse are usually psychoactive drugs that are used by
                    people for various different reasons which may include:<br />
                    1.Curiosity and peer pressure, especially among school children
                    and young adults. <br />2.The use of prescription drugs that
                    were originally intended to target pain relief may have turned
                    into recreational use and become addictive.<br />
                    3.Chemicals may be used as part of religious practices or
                    rituals.<br />4.Recreational purposes. <br />5.As a means of
                    obtaining creative inspiration.<br />
                    <b>Drug categories</b>
                    Drugs of abuse fall into three groups and these include:<br />
                    1.Depressants: These cause depression of the brain's faculties
                    and examples include sleeping pills (barbiturates) and
                    heroin.<br />
                    2.Stimulants: These cause stimulation of the brain, giving rise
                    to alertness and increased bursts of activity. A rapid heart
                    rate, dilated pupils, raised blood pressure, nausea or vomiting
                    and behavioral changes such as agitation, and impaired judgment
                    may also result. In severe cases, there may be delusional
                    psychosis which can occur with the use of cocaine and
                    amphetamines.<br />
                    3.Hallucinogens: These cause hallucinations and an "out of this
                    world" feeling of dissociation from oneself. Hallucinogens may
                    cause distorted sensory perception, delusion, paranoia and even
                    depression. Examples include ecstasy, mescaline and LSD. <br />

                <b>Alcoholism</b> is, broadly, any drinking of alcohol that
                    results in significant mental or physical health problems.[14]
                    Because there is disagreement on the definition of the word
                    alcoholism, it is not a recognized diagnostic entity.
                    Predominant diagnostic classifications are alcohol use
                    disorder[2] (DSM-5) or alcohol dependence (ICD-11); these are
                    defined in their respective sources. Excessive alcohol use can
                    damage all organ systems, but it particularly affects the brain,
                    heart, liver, pancreas and immune system.Alcoholism can result
                    in mental illness, delirium tremens, Wernicke–Korsakoff
                    syndrome, irregular heartbeat, an impaired immune response,
                    liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk.Drinking during
                    pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Women
                    are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful effects of
                    alcohol, primarily due to their smaller body weight, lower
                    capacity to metabolize alcohol, and higher proportion of body
                    fat.In a small number of individuals, prolonged, severe alcohol
                    misuse ultimately leads to cognitive impairment and frank
                    dementia. Environment and genetics are two factors in the risk
                    of development of alcoholism, with about half the risk
                    attributed to each.Stress and associated disorders, including
                    anxiety, are key factors in the development of alcoholism as
                    alcohol consumption can temporarily reduce dysphoria.Someone
                    with a parent or sibling with an alcohol use disorder is three
                    to four times more likely to develop an alcohol use disorder
                    themselves, but only a minority of them do.Environmental factors
                    include social, cultural and behavioral influences.High stress
                    levels and anxiety, as well as alcohol's inexpensive cost and
                    easy accessibility, increase the risk.People may continue to
                    drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal.After
                    a person stops drinking alcohol, they may experience a low level
                    of withdrawal lasting for months.Medically, alcoholism is
                    considered both a physical and mental illness. Questionnaires
                    are usually used to detect possible alcoholism.Further
                    information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.<br />
                    <b>Alcohol use disorder:</b>
                    Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves
                    problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with
                    alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes
                    problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to
                    get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you
                    rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes
                    a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.
                    Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your
                    health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related
                    problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of
                    drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours
                    or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge
                    drinking causes significant health and safety risks. If your
                    pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and
                    problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol
                    use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a
                    mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so
                    early treatment is important.<strong

                <strong>Women's empowerment (or female empowerment)</strong> may
                    be defined in several ways, including accepting women's
                    viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status
                    of women through education, awareness, literacy, and
                    training.Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make
                    life-determining decisions through the different societal
                    problems.They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles
                    or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue
                    desired goals. Women's empowerment has become a significant
                    topic of discussion in development and economics. Economic
                    empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources,
                    assets, and income. It also aids the ability to manage risk and
                    improve women's well-being.It can result in approaches to
                    support trivialized genders in a particular political or social
                    context.While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive
                    concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender,
                    stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a
                    role. Women empowerment helps boost women's status through
                    literacy, education, training and awareness creation.
                    Furthermore, women's empowerment refers to women's ability to
                    make strategic life choices that were previously denied them.
                    Nations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from
                    implementing programs and policies that adopt the notion of
                    female empowerment.Women's empowerment enhances the quality and
                    the quantity of human resources available for
                    development.Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns
                    when addressing human rights and development. Several principles
                    define women's empowerment, such as, for one to be empowered,
                    one must come from a position of disempowerment. They must
                    acquire empowerment rather than have it given to them by an
                    external party. Other studies have found that empowerment
                    definitions entail people having the capability to make
                    important decisions in their lives while also being able to act
                    on them. Empowerment and disempowerment are relative to each
                    other at a previous time; empowerment is a process rather than a
                    product.<br /><b
